## Session Notes

- Adopted a PostHog-inspired desktop/window aesthetic: beige dotted wallpaper, square window chrome with toolbar/bookmark bar, flat retro panels, and consistent max width across home, blog index, and post pages.
- Updated hero copy to match resume profile: “Maxi Gimenez — engineering leader building resilient products and teams,” emphasizing hands-on leadership at ChecklyHQ and cross-functional mentoring.
- Navigation bar under the window toolbar now links to Work/Projects/Blog/Resume/Email/GitHub/LinkedIn/Instagram. Removed side docks and moving marquee elements.
- Added a dedicated blog index page at `/blog` mirroring the window layout; all blog links updated to point to `/blog`.
- Blog post page uses the same window shell, bookmark bar, and footer placement as home; backgrounds unified (no gradient glows).
- Right column on home now has:
  - “Ongoing build” teaser linking to `/ongoing` (pending implementation), with a hammer icon and succinct description.
  - “Current role” panel with new stack (Vue.js, Nuxt.js, TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Vercel, AWS, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex), bullets aligned to resume, and ChecklyHQ linked.
- Simplified hero CTAs to “Talk with me” and “Download resume”; removed stats cards and leadership section; removed “Frontend craft” tag.
- Socials exclude X; footer aligns inside containers on all pages.

## Pending / Next Steps

- Build `/ongoing` page to expand the ongoing side-project teaser.
- If desired, add more PostHog-era details (icons, toolbar spacing) or refine spacing on bookmark bar/CTA.
